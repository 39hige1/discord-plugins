# Plugins
My different plugins.

## Hex Color Preview

Hex color values in a message will show up as the color they represent. You can hover over the value to see a popup of that color.

- [x] Add preview size option
- [x] Fix possible issue of slowing down Discord
- [x] Add option to leave hex values as normal text color, but keep hover preview
- [x] Add option to keep hex values as their color, but remove hover preview
- [ ] Maybe fix cut off for preview sizes that are too big(?)

## greentext plugin

This will not show up for people without the plugin. It's more of a theme for yourself than an extra feature.
